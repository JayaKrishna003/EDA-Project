# 🌾 Telangana Agricultural Market Analysis (2021–2025)

This repository contains my solo project submission for a data analysis hackathon, focused on uncovering **price trends, seasonal patterns, and commodity insights** using **daily agricultural market data from Telangana**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The agricultural sector in Telangana experiences frequent **price fluctuations** across commodities, directly affecting both farmers and consumers. This project analyzes data from **2021 to 2025** to identify:

- High and low price periods  
- Commodity demand patterns  
- District and yard-level differences  
- Volatility in market pricing  
- Seasonal behaviors of key crops

This analysis aims to help stakeholders (especially farmers) make **data-driven decisions** regarding crop selection and market timing.
